In this project I have collected the data from kaggle.com and working on Linear Regression.

Step1:
Creating a new path and installing all the dependencies

```
conda creata -n hello python=3.7 -y
```

```
conda activate hello
```

``` 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In this i have used modular fashion of code which will avoide the code reusability.

1. load_csv.py file is used to load the data set into the environment.
2. information_data.py file is used to preform the following operation:
        i.  shape of the data.
        ii. top 5 records.
